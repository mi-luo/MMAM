# Flame-detection(SFGDN)
A multi-scale and multi-constraint aggregation network (MMAN) for remote sensing image detection is proposed.

## install
```python 
git clone https://github.com/mi-luo/MMAM  # clone  
cd MMAM  
pip install -r requirements.txt  #  install
```


## Train
Our project is developed based on the ultralytics-yolov8 project, and its training, validation, and detection procedures are identical to those of the yolov8 project. For detailed operations, please refer to the following link: https://docs.ultralytics.com/#yolo-a-brief-history.



## Acknowledgements
  This paper and the related experiments utilize the publicly available datasets DOIR and DOTA-v1.0, with the code architecture developed based on YOLOv8. Below are the relevant paper titles associated with the experimental data and code.
  1.“Object detection in optical remote sensing images: A survey and A new benchmark“
  2.“DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images“
  3.“Real-time flying object detection with yolov8“

We sincerely appreciate the spirit of open sharing demonstrated by these organizations and hope that their datasets and codes can provide valuable insights for research and development in the field of high-resolution remote sensing.
